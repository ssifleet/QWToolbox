Description: QW Toolbox aids in review of internal USGS discrete water-quality data. This package pulls data directly from local, internal NWIS servers and rapidly produces a wide range of useful plots for QAQC and data exploration. Additional tools include a function for uploading non-NWQL data, exporting data, generating QAQC reports, and tabulating samples for re-run submission. This beta version (0.1) currently includes plotting reutines, generating basic data tables, and non-NWQL upload tools.
