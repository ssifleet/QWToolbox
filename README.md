## Package overview
This package facilitates data review and exploration of discrete water-quality data 
through rapid and easy-to-use plotting functions and tabular data summaries.
Data is imported with user-specified options for single or multiple sites and parameter codes using
an ODBC connection to the user's local NWIS server. A graphical user interface allows the user to easily 
explore their data through a variety of graphical and tabular outputs. Because this packages uses an ODBC
connection and graphical user interface, it requires special installation procedures beyond a typical R package.
Please see the section on installation instructions for further information.
